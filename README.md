This project attempts to use NLP to determine whether an X post is describing an actual disaster or if it's being metaphorical. The project is composed of the Deliverable1.ipynb file, which contains all the exploration and analysis, a submission.csv file containing the submitted model for the competition, and a Deliverable3.png file containing the score for the submission. The notebook contains headers indicating each section. The cells have been run already, allowing you to easily view the output.
